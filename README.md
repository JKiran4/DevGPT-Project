# DATA 542 Final Project, DevGPT dataset analysis

### Background
DevGPT is a comprehensive dataset of 17,913 ChatGPT prompts and answers which are grouped into several software development artifacts (commits, issues, discussions, files, pull requests, and hacker news sharings). All data was retrieved from the DevGPT repository: https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT. The files in the repository are also split into folders corresponding to different snapshots in time and are in a json format. Our goal in this project is to join these files together to explore three research questions related to the converstaions with ChatGPT:

1. What types of issues (bugs, feature requests, theoretical questions, etc.) do developers most commonly present to ChatGPT?
2. How do the answers provided by ChatGPT vary between models (length, content, tone, etc.)?
3. Can we predict a textâ€™s author from the content alone?

### Methodology
Our methodology varies slightly for each research question, specifically with the data we used. For RQ1 and RQ2 we use 'snapshot_20231012', as they are primarily focused on exploration of the data as opposed to building a machine learning model. For RQ3, we use the entire dataset. For all of these questions, we join each of the software development artifacts files into a single master file, ensuring we extract columns that are typically nested within the json structure.
